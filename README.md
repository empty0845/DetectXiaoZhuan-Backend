# **DetectXiaoZhuan-Backend**

This repository contains the backend code for the **DetectXiaoZhuan** project, which is designed to detect XiaoZhuan (small seal script) characters using YOLOv5. The backend includes model handling and database interaction logic.

## Alternative Version Branch
A different version is available in the branch **`feature/video-version`**, which allows videos to be displayed on the frontend.

### How to Switch to the Video Version

1. Ensure you are using the **`feature/video-version`** branch from this repository.
2. Verify that the frontend is using the **`feature/video-version`** branch from the corresponding frontend repository.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the `readme.md` file.
4. **Note:** Due to copyright concerns, the actual video URLs are not included in the `newtable.sql` file. Users must add their own video URLs to the database.

## Related Repositories

- [Frontend](https://github.com/empty0845/DetectXiaoZhuan-WeChat.git): The front-end that displays the results generated by this backend API.
- [Dataset](https://github.com/empty0845/DetectXiaoZhuan-Dataset.git): The dataset used for training the model, although the model is already pre-trained and available for use in the backend.

## Character Explanations and Evolution Sources
The character explanations used in this project are sourced from **[Zdic.net](https://www.zdic.net/)**, and the character evolution images are sourced from **[Guoxuedashi.net](https://www.guoxuedashi.net/)**

## **Project Structure**

- **`/static/new_image/`**: Directory for images containing XiaoZhuan characters.
- **`/static/new_logo/`**: Directory for the program logo images.

- **`./id_to_uuid.json`**: A JSON file mapping IDs to a dictionary containing `{uuid, name}` for each item.
- **`./newtable.sql`**: SQL script for importing data into a MySQL database.
- **`./models/`**: Directory containing the trained YOLOv5 model files.

- **`./mysql.py`**: Python script for handling MySQL database operations.
- **`./server.py`**: Flask server code to expose API endpoints and handle client requests.
- **`./Yolo.py`**: Python script for YOLOv5 model operations (loading the model, inference, etc.).

## **Installation & Setup**

### 1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DetectXiaoZhuan-Backend.git
cd DetectXiaoZhuan-Backend
```

### 2. **Install dependencies**
It is recommended to use Python 3.9.

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Set up the MySQL database**
- Ensure you have MySQL installed and running.
- Create a new database (e.g., `xiao_zhuan_db`).
- Run the SQL script `newtable.sql` to import necessary tables.

### 4. **Configure the Flask server**
- Update the database connection settings in `mysql.py` with your MySQL credentials (host, username, password, database name).
- If necessary, update any model paths or configurations in `server.py` or `Yolo.py`.

### 5. **Run the server**
To start the Flask server:

```bash
python server.py
```

The server will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.

## **File Descriptions**

- **`id_to_uuid.json`**: A mapping file where each recordâ€™s ID is mapped to a unique UUID and a name. This is used for identifying the detected characters.
- **`newtable.sql`**: The SQL script to set up the necessary database tables for storing detection results and other data.
- **`models/`**: Contains the trained YOLOv5 models. Ensure the correct model is loaded when performing inference.
- **`mysql.py`**: Contains functions for interacting with the MySQL database, such as querying and inserting data.
- **`server.py`**: The main Flask server file, which hosts the RESTful API and handles incoming requests related to XiaoZhuan character detection.
- **`Yolo.py`**: The code responsible for loading and running the YOLOv5 model to perform object detection on input images.
